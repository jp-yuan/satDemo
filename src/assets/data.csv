"6-Jazz tap is a dance form that was first developed in
African American communities. Jazz tap was heavily
influenced by jazz music, which became widely
popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap
dancers were inspired by jazz music's quick rhythms
and by the way jazz musicians would make up
melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to
develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with
it. Because of jazz music's influence, jazz tap quickly
developed into a dance form that was very different
from earlier kinds of tap dance.

"7-The north celestial pole (NCP)—the fixed point
around which stars in the Northern Hemisphere
(including the Sun) appear to rotate—is discernible
only at night. Inspired by the navigational strategies
of some insects and birds, researchers devised a
method for locating the NCP in daytime using
skylight polarization, which occurs as atmospheric
particles scatter sunlight. A polarimetric camera
captures images of polarization patterns, which
rotate as the Sun's position in the sky changes;
temporal variances across images can then be used to
determine an observer's latitude and bearing relative
to the NCP.
","Which choice best describes the overall structure of
the text?",N/A,"A) It illustrates how most navigational tools utilize
the NCP, recounts how researchers discovered
that certain animals are able to navigate without
using the NCP, and then proposes that this
discovery could be used to avoid problems in
navigation associated with reliance on the NCP","B) It presents a celestial-based method of
navigation, enumerates the comparative benefits
of an alternative method used by certain animals
that is based on an unrelated natural occurrence,
and then indicates how researchers assessed the
relative accuracy of the two methods.","C) It explains how the NCP is typically located,
emphasizes a key difference between how
humans and certain animals use the NCP for
navigation, and then suggests an alternative way
of using the NCP to improve existing

from his back door. On its banks at this point
grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias
and bay trees. On the bosom of the stream
float millions of delicately colored hyacinths.

"9-Astronomers are confident that the star Betelgeuse
will eventually consume all the helium in its core and
explode in a supernova. They are much less
confident, however, about when this will happen,
since that depends on internal characteristics of
Betelgeuse that are largely unknown. Astrophysicist
Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently
investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could
be used to determine internal stellar states but
concluded that this method could not sufficiently
reveal Betelgeuse's internal characteristics to allow its
evolutionary state to be firmly fixed.

"10-Text 1
Astronomer Mark Holland and colleagues examined
four white dwarfs—small, dense remnants of past
stars—in order to determine the composition of
exoplanets that used to orbit those stars. Studying
wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres,
the team reported that traces of elements such as
lithium and sodium support the presence of
exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth's.
Text 2
Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have
concluded that certain exoplanets had continental
crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer
Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize
atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual
elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on
Earth. The studies don't adequately account for
different minerals made up of various ratios of those
elements, and the possibility of rock types not found
on Earth that contain those minerals.
","Based on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu
(Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion
presented in Text 1?",N/A,"A) As unexpected, because it was widely believed at
the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack
continental crusts","B) As premature, because researchers have only just
begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts
white dwarf exoplanets had","C) As questionable, because it rests on an
incomplete consideration of potential sources
of the elements detected in white dwarf
atmospheres","D) As puzzling, because it's unusual to successfully
detect lithium and sodium when analyzing
wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres",C,Reading and Writing Module 1

punching bags used by boxers into art by decorating
them with beadwork and elements of Native
dressmaking. These elements include leather fringe
and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses
worn in the jingle dance, a women's dance of the
Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object
commonly associated with masculinity (a punching
bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women
in most Native communities (beadwork and
dressmaking). In this way, he rejects the division of
male and female gender roles.

"16-Archaeologist Petra Vaiglova, anthropologist
Xinyi Liu, and their colleagues investigated the
domestication of farm animals in China during the
Bronze Age (approximately 2000 to 1000 BCE). By
analyzing the chemical composition of the bones of
sheep, goats, and cattle from this era, the team
determined that wild plants made up the bulk of
sheep's and goats' diets, while the cattle's diet
consisted largely of millet, a crop cultivated by
humans. The team concluded that cattle were likely
raised closer to human settlements, whereas sheep
and goats were allowed to roam farther away.

"8-The following text is from Charlotte Forten Grimké's
1888 poem "At Newport."
Oh, deep delight to watch the gladsome waves
Exultant leap upon the rugged rocks;
Ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on—
Filled with a life that will not know defeat;
To see the glorious hues of sky and sea.
The distant snowy sails, glide spirit like,
Into an unknown world, to feel the sweet
Enchantment of the sea thrill all the soul,
Clearing the clouded brain, making the heart
Leap joyous as it own bright, singing waves!
","Which choice best describes the function of the
underlined portion in the text as a whole?",N/A,"A) It portrays the surroundings as an imposing and
intimidating scene.","B) It characterizes the sea's waves as a relentless and

"9-Believing that living in an impractical space can
heighten awareness and even improve health,
conceptual artists Madeline Gins and Shusaku
Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan to
be more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter
is chest-high on one side and knee-high on the other;
a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is
disorienting but invigorating: after four years there,
filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant
health benefits.
",Which choice best states the main idea of the text?,N/A,"A) Although inhabiting a home surrounded by
fanciful features such as those designed by Gins
and Arakawa can be rejuvenating, it is
unsustainable.","B) Designing disorienting spaces like those in the
Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective
way to create a physically stimulating
environment.","C) As a filmmaker, Yamaoka has long supported
the designs of conceptual artists such as Gins
and Arakawa.","D) Although impractical, the design of the
apartment building by Gins and Arakawa may
improve the well-being of the building's
residents.",,Reading and Writing Module 2
"10-The following text is adapted from Lewis Carroll's
1889 satirical novel Sylvie and Bruno. A crowd has
gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden,
an official who reports to the Lord Chancellor.
One man, who was more excited than the rest,
flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as
well as I could make out) "Who roar for the
Sub-Warden?" Everybody roared, but whether it
was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly
appear: some were shouting "Bread!" and some
"Taxes!", but no one seemed to know what it was
they really wanted.
All this I saw from the open window of the
Warden's breakfast-saloon, looking across the
shoulder of the Lord Chancellor.
"What can it all mean?" he kept repeating to
himself. "I never heard such shouting
before—and at this time of the morning, too!
And with such unanimity!"
","Based on the text, how does the Lord Chancellor
respond to the crowd?",N/A,"A) He asks about the meaning of the crowd's
shouting, even though he claims to know what
the crowd wants.","B) He indicates a desire to speak to the crowd, even
though the crowd has asked to speak to the
Sub-Warden.","C) He expresses sympathy for the crowd's demands,
even though the crowd's shouting annoys him.","D) He describes the crowd as being united, even
though the crowd clearly appears otherwise.",,Reading and Writing Module 2

"12-Studying tools unearthed at a cave site on the western coast of Italy,
archaeologist Paola Villa and colleagues have determined that
prehistoric Neanderthal groups fashioned them from shells of clams
that they harvested from the seafloor while wading or diving or that
washed up on the beach. Clamshells become thin and eroded as they
wash up on the beach, while those on the seafloor are smooth and
sturdy, so the research team suspects that Neanderthals prized the tools
made with seafloor shells. However, the team also concluded that those
tools were likely more challenging to obtain, noting that ______
","Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the
research team's conclusion?",In the SAT Free drive,"A) at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the
numbers of tools of each type suggests that shells were easier to
collect from the beach than to harvest from the seafloor.","B) the highest number of tools were at a depth of 3–4 meters below
the surface, which suggests that the Neanderthal population at the
site was highest during the related period of time","C) at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the
numbers of tools of each type suggests that Neanderthals preferred
to use clamshells from the beach because of their durability.","D) the higher number of tools at depths of 5–6 meters below the
surface in the cave than at depths of 4–5 meters below the surface
suggests that the size of clam populations changed over time.",,Reading and Writing Module 2
"13-Perovskite solar cells convert light into electricity
more efficiently than earlier kinds of solar cells, and
manufacturing advances have recently made them
commercially attractive. One limitation of the cells,
however, has to do with their electron transport layer
(ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass.
Often the ETL is applied through a process called
spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient
at converting input power to output power.
André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray
coating method for applying the ETL. The team
produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded
that spray coating holds promise for improving the
power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite
solar cells.","Which choice best describes data from the graph that
support Taylor and colleagues' conclusion?",In the SAT Free drive,"A) Both the ETL applied through spin coating and
the ETL applied through spray coating showed a
power conversion efficiency greater than 10% at
their lowest performing thickness.","B) The lowest performing ETL applied through
spray coating had a higher power conversion
efficiency than the highest performing ETL
applied through spin coating.","C) The highest performing ETL applied through
spray coating showed a power conversion
efficiency of approximately 13%, while the
highest performing ETL applied through spin
coating showed a power conversion efficiency of
approximately 11%.","D) There was a substantial difference in power
conversion efficiency between the lowest and
highest performing ETLs applied through spray
coating.",,Reading and Writing Module 2

"15-The linguistic niche hypothesis (LNH) posits that the
exotericity of languages (how prevalent non-native
speakers are) and grammatical complexity are
inversely related, which the LNH ascribes to attrition
of complex grammatical rules as more non-native
speakers adopt the language but fail to acquire those
rules. Focusing on two characteristics that are
positive indices of grammatical complexity, fusion
(when new phonemes arise from the merger of
previously distinct ones) and informativity
(languages' capacity for meaningful variation),
Olena Shcherbakova and colleagues conducted a
quantitative analysis for more than 1,300 languages
and claim the outcome is inconsistent with the LNH.
","Which finding, if true, would most directly support
Shcherbakova and colleagues' claim?",,"A) Shcherbakova and colleagues' analysis showed
a slightly negative correlation between
grammatical complexity and fusion and between
